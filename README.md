SNAKE GAME

OVERVIEW

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen, consuming food to grow longer while avoiding collisions with itself. In this implementation, the snake moves across the walls, meaning it will reappear on the opposite side when it moves off one edge of the screen. This edge-wrapping feature adds a strategic element to the gameplay.
